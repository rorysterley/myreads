# MyReads Project

MyReads is a bookshelf for tracking books the user wishes to read, has read or is currently reading.


## Installation and Viewing

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the demo server with `npm start`


## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.


## Credits

Special thanks to Udacity for providing the starter files for this project.
